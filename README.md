# CoffeeMachine

This is part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" class. 

This is my attempt at the day 15 project: Coffee Machine. There are definitely a number of things to fix and
optimize, but it appears to work and satisfy the requirements of the project.

The user will be asked what kind of drink they want. They'll be told the price and then have to insert a number
of coins to equal or exceed that price. Refunds will be issued if the user is short on change or inserts too much.

The machine has a limited supply of resources to make the drinks. When it does not have enough of a resource to 
make a drink, it will display what resource it is low on.

For maintenance purposes, the word "report" can be typed in place of a drink to see the available resources
in the machine.
